# TAB-ID  
Pull Tab Classification Index  

**Find All The Tabs!**  
POPTAB.Museum is a community-driven, open-source archive of identified pull tabs — from the earliest ring pulls to modern stay-on tabs. Our mission is to classify every color, type, brand, and variation as they’re discovered, building the world’s first and most complete index of pull tabs.  

---

## 🎯 Mission  
- Classify and index every pull tab variation from 1960 to the present  
- Build open datasets for researchers, collectors, and curious minds  
- Create tools to help identify, classify, and explore tabs  
- Foster a collaborative collectors’ community with open standards

## 🌍 Community Vibe  
This isn’t just a database — it’s a cultural experiment in finding value in collaborative collecting.

- Tabs are **artifacts**  
- Tabs are **memes**  
- Tabs are **history you can hold in your hand**  

We invite everyone — collectors, artists, designers, historians, archivists — to help shape the museum.
